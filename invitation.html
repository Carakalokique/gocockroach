    <p>You quit your job less than a year or two ago. You manage to replace your income or surpass it. Throughout the journey, you've had to push through struggles. I want to hear about how you overcame those and share the stories to inspire people!</p>

  <p>It's been quite easy to find people that are way way far down the line and already settled in the game.</p>

  <p>But I've been having a harder time finding content from people that just replaced their income and their journey.</p>

  <h2>The idea 💡</h2>
  <p>Chat with you on a 45-minute call over the good ol' phone. I don't know about you but I miss the time where I would spend hours on the phone… and the camera makes it feel awkward sometimes. I like to move around while talking!</p>

  <p>After our conversation, I'll grab the transcript and write an article.</p>

  <h2>Sharing 📢</h2>
  <p>I'll share the article on this website and will share snippets of the interview on Twitter as well.</p>

  <h2>The topic 💬</h2>
  <p>Why you quit your job, your struggles, how you overcame them, how you crafted your offer or built your product.</p>

  <h2>What's next 👋</h2>
  <p>If you're interested, please shoot me a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/KennyAlami" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and book a time below.</p>
